   title = {The use of lithic raw materials during the Upper Paleolithic in eastern China: A focus on microblade industries},
   journal = {Quaternary International},
   abstract = {During the Upper Paleolithic, many sites with microblade industries were distributed across northeastern China and the North China Plain in eastern China. Based on the composition of lithic raw materials (LRMs) and the site distributions of microblade industries, this study defined five territories of human groups in two regions of China: 1) the western Changbai Shan Mountains (Mount Paektu) and Song-Nen Plain in northeastern China and 2) the southern Yanshan Mountains, Yi-Shu River Basin, and western Huang-Huai Plain in the North China Plain. In northeastern China, high-quality LRMs, including various types of igneous rock and obsidian, were used in combination with local LRMs such as flint and agate. Based on the distribution range of high-quality LRMs, the territories of human groups in that region are estimated at 300–450 km. It is believed that residential systems were established for the long-distance transport of LRMs and the long-distance movement of human groups. One such system included microblade technology based on biface and flake-blade reduction systems. In contrast, the territory of human groups in the North China Plain was small, with an area estimated at 100–230 km. Given the numerous small sites in that region, it is believed that human groups moved frequently within their territories because they were highly mobile and dependent on local LRM sources (e.g., flint) near their occupation sites. Human groups might have employed various microcore reduction systems to produce microblades, even from limited LRMs. Preliminary conclusions suggest that the divergent activities of late Upper Paleolithic human groups in eastern China could reflect variations in regional economic strategies and ecological environments between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Younger Dryas.},

   title = {Population density, mobility, and cultural transmission},
   journal = {Journal of Archaeological Science},
   volume = {74},
   pages = {75-84},
   abstract = {Prompted by the results of a series of recently published simulation models, there is an increasing tendency for archaeologists to invoke demographic variables as explanations for changes in the sophistication or complexity of material culture. Whilst these models are undoubtedly valuable, this paper draws attention to persistent failings in the interpretation and application of these models by archaeologists. Despite having quite different effects, variables such as population size and population density are often used interchangeably; and whilst increasing mobility has an effect broadly equivalent to that of increasing population density, it is rarely given sufficient weight in archaeological explanations of cultural change. The analyses reported here develop a series of new simulations based on the ideal gas model, allowing for an explicit prediction of the encounter rate – the variable for which population density and mobility are proxies, and which ultimately governs the rate of cultural transmission. This model supports the predictions of earlier studies on the effects of population density and mobility, but suggests that population size will have no effect on rates of cultural transmission. These simulations are coupled with analyses that demonstrate a reciprocal correlation between population density and mobility in a large hunter-gatherer dataset. Given this correlation, it is argued that archaeological inferences about cultural transmission based on just one of these variables are unlikely to be valid. These findings are discussed in the context of previous research, and it is suggested that future studies would gain greater explanatory power by focusing explicitly on the social network structures likely to have characterised a particular archaeological population.},

   abstract = {<p>Culturally transmitted behavior can be structured in its performance both geographically and temporally, in terms of where and when implements are made and used on the landscape (what Ingold calls “the taskscape”). Yet cultural transmission theory has not yet explored the consequences of behaviors transmitted differently due to their enactment at different taskscape locations, what Tostevin calls “taskscape visibility.” Here, we use computer simulations to explore how taskscape visibility and forager mobility affect the diversity of two selectively neutral culturally transmitted traits within a single population of social learners. The trait that can be transmitted from residential bases only (lower taskscape visibility) shows greater diversity than the trait that can be transmitted from residential bases and logistical camps (higher taskscape visibility). In addition, increased logistical mobility has a positive effect on the diversity of the trait with the lower taskscape visibility while it generally shows little to no effect on the diversity of the trait with higher taskscape visibility. Without an appreciation for the ways in which taskscape visibility and mobility can structure cultural transmission in space and through time, the difference in the observed equilibrium diversity levels of the two traits might be incorrectly interpreted as resulting from qualitatively different forms of biased cultural transmission. The results of our simulation experiment suggest that researchers may need to take the taskscape visibility into account when inferring cultural transmission from archaeological data.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Xiaochangliang (XCL), located in the Nihewan Basin of North China, is a key archaeological locality for understanding the behavioural evolution of early humans. XCL dates to ca. 1.36 Ma, making it one of the earliest sites in Northeast Asia. Although XCL represents the first excavation of an Early Pleistocene site in the Nihewan Basin, identified and excavated in the 1970’s, the lithic assemblages have never been published in full detail. Here we describe the lithic assemblages from XCL, providing information on stone tool reduction techniques and the influence of raw materials on artefact manufacture. The XCL hominins used both bipolar and freehand reduction techniques to manufacture small flakes, some of which show retouch. Bipolar reduction methods at XCL were used more frequently than previously recognized. Comparison of XCL with other Early Pleistocene sites in the Nihewan Basin indicates the variable use of bipolar and freehand reduction methods, thereby indicating a flexible approach in the utilization of raw materials. The stone tools from XCL and the Nihewan sites are classifiable as Mode I lithic assemblages, readily distinguished from bifacial industries manufactured by hominins in Eastern Asia by ca. 800 ka.</p>},
